// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "The requirements of the project must be well defined and then looked at closesly to ensure all cases are laid out before design begins. This will allow for smoother design of the final product."

const design = "An initial architecture of the project should be created to set a good foundation. Once the architecture is set a prototype can be built with less resources to do some proof of concept testing."

const implementation = "If the prototype looks good then the full prodcut can enter production. Depending on the scale this could be a single person or an entire department."

const tetingAndIntegration = "Once the product has been built is must be tested rigorougsly to work out any bugs and errors in the code. These will be more common when combining code from different teams. Once the testing shows that the final platform performs as expected it can be integraded into its working enviroment"

const maintain = "After deployment, maintenance wll always be required. There will likely be bugs that pop up as well as general maintenance, upgrades, and new features. Sometimes maintenace can take on this entire cycle again."
